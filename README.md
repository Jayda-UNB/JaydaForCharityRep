Hi everyone! I'm Jayda and I'm running for the Charity Representative for the UNB Computer Science Association!

I am passionate about increasing community involvement in the CS faculty. I believe this can be helped through proper funding for the CSA, which will help CSA events cater to a wider range of individuals in our community. I participated in the CSAâ€™s 2024 Extra Life event which was a great success, and I would like to help further contribute to such charity efforts. Furthermore, I participated in multiple charity drives throughout high school aimed at those with food and financial insecurity within my local community. As a CS House peer mentor, I have directly engaged with first years and helped introduce them to the faculty and to our university as a whole. Additionally, I have served as a Teaching Assistant for the faculty since Fall 2024, and in the process have helped many students in their academics. I also have experience handling finances both in my own life and through studying financial literacy in high school. In general, I am passionate about getting involved and I will use my community experiences as well as financial skills to ensure that our faculty thrives.
